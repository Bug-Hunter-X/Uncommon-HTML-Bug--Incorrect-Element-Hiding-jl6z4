This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML and CSS concerning element visibility.  The bug involves using the CSS `visibility` property instead of `display` to show or hide elements. While seemingly similar, this creates a subtle difference in layout.  `visibility: hidden;` will still reserve space for the element, while `display: none;` completely removes the element from the layout flow. The solution corrects the issue by using the correct `display` property.
